This vanilla javascript framework will alow to read files in a special format for Resolution Independet Graphics (RIG) and output them to a HTML5 canvas, so that their size can dynamically be changed (e.g. to adopt to differnt screen sizes).

This project is currently under development. Documentation will be updated as it moves along.

Participation is highly encouraged.
